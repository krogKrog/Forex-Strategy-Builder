  <description>This is an "empty" strategy.

You can use it as a base to build your strategy from scratch.

Feel free to experiment!

You can set the opening and the closing point of the position, add opening or closing logic conditions, and adjust the strategy properties.

The "Opening Point of the Position" slot shows the price, at which the strategy enters the market and adds/removes from an open position. We enter the market at a price level determined by an indicator value or by time ("Bar Opening" for example). However, before we open position we need confirmation from the "Opening Logic Condition" slots.

The "Opening Logic Conditions" basically tell you whether to enter the market or not when the entry price has been reached. They also determine the position's direction (whether we enter short or long). There is no any "Opening Logic Condition" in this strategy and that leads to undetermined entry direction.   Because of that the program doesnâ€™t open positions during the backtest.

The "Closing Point of the Position" sets the exit price. If you set it at "Bar Closing", you can add "Closing Logic Conditions". They will block the exit until at least one of them is fulfilled. If you do not use "Closing Logic Conditions", the position will be closed when the "Closing Point" is reached.

The Strategy Overview explains the strategy logic in an additional window and can be exported to a file.

Look in the forum for help or more information on creating forex strategies.

Remember! The strategy slots describe the long position logic only. Forex Strategy Builder will set the short position logic automatically using the same logic but in the opposite direction.
